Conclusion:
After clustering the data set it is the time to get a conclusion; as we saw there are five clusters, zero to four. I looked at each cluster’s features and found some interesting facts:

Cluster 1 : they have lowest of  Cash_Advance, Balance, Purchase, Credit limit, Payment, so they are new customers and should be targeted to send credit card offers with higher credit limit, tenure.

Cluster 4: also has the same behavior like cluster 1, they may be merged with cluster 1 and targeted the same.

Cluster 2 : they have highest Credit limit, full payments, payments, Purchase and… these are prime customers and should receive offers with some benefits like Air-mile, Hotel discount… and also increase their credit limit to encourage them use more.

Cluster3 : they have medium balance, payment and credit limit and high purchase, they need to recieve offer with higher credit limit.

Cluster 0: they have high Cash advance, Balance and low Purchase, they use their credit as a loan and are lucrative for credit companies.
